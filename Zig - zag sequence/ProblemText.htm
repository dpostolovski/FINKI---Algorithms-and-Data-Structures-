<p>For example, -1 2 -9 8 -4 is a zig-zag sequence, while -1 9 7 -3 8 -3 is not because 9 and 7 are successive and also positive numbers. A zig-zag sequence can start either with positive or negative number. Any sequence of one non-zero number is a zig-zag sequence. Given a sequence of numbers, write an algorithm that returns the length of the longest zig-zag subsequence.</p>
<p>The first line of the input is the length of the sequence N.  The numbers of the sequence follow in the next N lines. The output should print the length of the longest zig-zag subsequence in the given sequence.</p>
