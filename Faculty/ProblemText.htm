Petko can solve only one assignment at a time. Write an algorithm which for a given number of subjects and estimation of hours that Petko needs to solve each assignment, calculates the minimum number of penalty points he will get for submitting the assignments..</p>
<p>The number of the assignments N is given in the first input line. The hours required for solving each assignment follow in the next N lines. Output should print the minimum number of penalty points.</p>
